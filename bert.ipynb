    "Hey everyone! Today, we'll be going over some more specific examples of common Python applications. Meaning, we'll dive deeper into some more useful and technical packages supported by Python. Just a brief caveat: there may be parts of this talk that are overly technical, or just may not be relevant to you. That's okay. I think it's important to go over examples of more technical Python use-cases, so we have a greater perspective about what Python can be used for. And, as long as you have some Python knowledge, or programming experience, I feel it's okay if you're feeling a little lost at certain parts of this talk, since I essentially divided this talk into segments.\n",

This model will allow us to make very accurate predictions about the sentiment of movie reviews, which will hopefully be somewhat fun for some of you.\n",

    "So, let me just start off by saying there's been a lot of progress in NLP over the last decade. Going back to the early 2000s, a guy named Bengio proposed the first neural language model using a neural network, where machine translation was fairly expensive and somewhat hard to solve. At that time, statistical models, such as the continuous bag-of-words model, were used to solve fairly simple NLP tasks, such as next-word prediction and spell checking. This model was useful for predicting next words in sentences, but lacked the ability to pick up on the context of words in sentences, or really understand any of the relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, starting at around 2010, many more complex NLP problems were beginning to be solved. For one, Apple's Siri became known as one of the world’s first successful NLP assistants to be used by general consumers. So, problems like question and answering and chat bots were beginning to be solved. And, these types of NLP models were beginning to be able to pick up on the context of words in sentences. But, these tasks were still fairly expensive and slow. Plus, it was still somewhat difficult to understand the relationships between words for longer sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the last decade, companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and others, were able to build more complex neural network architectures, which allowed them to solve more complex NLP problems. And, they were able to capture relationships in very long sentences fairly well. Google, for example, trained a network called BERT, which was able to solve some of these problems very well. Other networks have since been released by other companies, but they really pioneered this movement towards using sequence networks for NLP tasks, which allowed companies to easily create chat bots, summarize text, perform auto-completion, translate text from one language to another, and so much more.\n",

So, over the last decade, Google has spent billions of dollars researching ways of solving some of these complex NLP problems, and developing a neural architecture to do this efficiently. As I mentioned earlier, they were able to do this in 2018 when they created BERT. Generously, they open-sourced this model to the public.

    "Before I go any further into the specifics of model training, let me just make sure we all know why we want to train BERT or any other neural network. As a I said earlier, BERT was built to be used for many different NLP tasks, such as predicting next sentences, topic classification, sentiment classification, and many more NLP tasks. More technically, BERT was built for making predictions about sequential data, which many NLP tasks are. So, BERT is useful for us here, because we're interested in sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do we want to train our network on more data, if BERT learned from millions and millions of sentences by Google for various NLP tasks already. Well, it's because BERT was trained on a lot of general data, so in order for us to get more accurate predictions, we need to fine tune our model to focus more on movie reviews, rather than make predictions on all Wikipedia data. Basically, BERT provides a great start for a lot of NLP tasks, but we will usually still need to fine tune it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, normally when we want to train any model, we'll split our data into a training set and test set. The training set will be used for the model to actually learn from our training data, and the test set will be used for us to validate the accuracy of our model after training. The training set is usually somewhere between 70-90% of our entire dataset. For now, we'll just assign the size of our test set to be 20% of our total movie reviews.\n",

    "Again, our BERT model can only understand numeric data. So, we'll just quickly tokenize our input data. Notice, our review contains 4 words, but the output of our tokenizer contains 6 tokens. At first you might think this is a mistake, but it's actually just a great example of how complex and smart our pre-trained tokenizer is. This tokenizer basically looks at some text, and doesn't just map individual words to a number. But, it actually maps parts of words Google deemed was important in understanding the context behind these sentences. So, 101 might refer to the word *I*, then 178 might refer to the word *love*, or 178 might refer to the first two letters of *love*: *lo*. We can take a closer look at the internals of what these numbers are actually mapped too, but unfortunately we'd need to look at the internals of the tokenizer object. So, for now, just take my word for it.\n",
